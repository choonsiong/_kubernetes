# README

- Node is a machine, physical or virtual machine where k8s installed.
- Cluster is a set of nodes group together.
    - Sharing load
    - Failover
- The master node responsible for all worker nodes
- K8S components
    - Master node
        - API server (frontend for k8s)
        - etcd (key-value store)
        - Container runtime (to run container, e.g. docker, rkt, CRI-O)
        - Controller
        - Scheduler
    - Worker node
        - Kubelet (interact with Master node)
    - Command line util `kubectl`
- OCI includes
    - imagespec - container image spec
    - runtimespec - container runtime spec
- `dockershim` allows docker to work with k8s (by passing CRI)
    - CRI is required for k8s to support other container runtime, but docker itself is not CRI compatible
- `containerd` (the daemon manage `runc` part of docker) is CRI compatible
    - k8s (v1.24) removes `dockershim` eventually and supports only `containerd`
